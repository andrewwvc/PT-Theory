To those who are new to my theory and why I am developing it, I'm going to have to explain why I believe it is valuable. The thing is, a good part of why it was even possible to come up with it is due to what I am not. Specifically, I am not a prodigy and the abilities that I now have are ones that I struggled to earn over time, only to eventually to end up developing them many years later than someone who might be considered a genuis would have. But it is exactly because of this that this allowed me to chart the progress of my own mental development and percieve it in comparative terms. A Mozart could never have developed what I have come up with because someone of that calibur of mind will have spent their whole existance immersed in a mental life that has never known and could hence never remember what it was like to not experience the world with the perception of the faclties that enable their genius. So what sets me apart is that I have grown slowly, and because I have taken that time to do so I have many, many memories of NOT beng able to experience certain things, which I have been able to directly contrast with how I experience my own perceptual and imaginative abilities now. That I have the personal experience to do this systematically has allowed me to percieve certain structural aspects of various kinds of artworks and how the potential to percieve them has arisen in my own mind. This project is not yet 'complete' as there are specific faculties that I have good reason to believe exist and which I do not currently posess. If I end up unlocking them and am capable of charting my progress of development in the same way as I have so far, then I may well end up having the most comprehensive understanding of how the mental structures that give rise to aesthetic experience arise in the mind so far.
