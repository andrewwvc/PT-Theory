At this point, I want to lay out what my goals are for this project:

- To explore, using specific examples, what it feels like to understand poetry and explain how this experience compares to what the same works are like when lacking the faculties necessary in order for this to be possible so that the differences between the kind of comprehension that is possible in each case becomes clearer. Then I want to show how this manifests in biases which lead a person to interpret specific kinds of structures as being meaningful where they previously would not have been.

- To show why I believe that the mental structures that enable the comprehension of a symphony, those that become active on gaining SGP, are fundamentally the same in kind as that which allows the total apprehension of poetry. I will try to do this by showing how the basic processes of Variant Addition (covered here and here) can also potentially be applied to language that provides a metric stricture to enable poetic structures that extend the scope of how a given person can perceive grammar.

- To illustrate how the meters of verse forms are apprehended such that they only possible in general through SGP and are actually experienced primarily as high level variant structure, and seemingly aren't the same as the low level, regular rhythms that are the basis for most music. Following this, I want to divide language constructs, with respect to a given language, into canonical, variant and divergent categories. This should show why, in principal, variant poetic sentences which are alterations of canonical sentences (i.e. by swapping around the orders of words) can still comprehended as making sense poetically, and how this is different from sentences which may be felt to simply be entirely grammatically wrong, even if their intended meaning might be clear.

- To show that SGP and VI respectively (the combination of which that allows the full scope of poetry being called the super-eidosic faculty) provide the structural and metaphoric possibilities that allow unified Ideas to be composed through language. In doing this, I hope to revive an older tradition of linguistics that attempted to find ways of delineating poetic language from normal language. I argue that, for a certain definition of poetic language, such delineation is very much in principal possible (save that a certain amount of cultural context that is relative will inevitably affect any attempt to do this).

- Then I can explain why I believe that Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar, which covers the structures which are deemed to be necessary to allow a given person (ideally a 'native speaker') to learn which sentences feel grammatical or non-grammatical in a given language, does not actually cover the constructs that Super Grammatical Perception does which extend the capability of the language faculty to allow for poetic grammar. I will do this by assuming (regardless of what Chomsky actually believes) a conception of UG, the 'default' language processing ability that everyone who is capable of learning a native language that uses 'merge' [] processes, that only covers constructs that do not require SGP to intuitively comprehend. In addition, I also posit that such structures are likely limited to context-free [] constructs, and that all language constructs of greater complexity are either apprehended poetically (with SGP providing intuitive comprehension of parallel structures in a unified way) or analytically (implying they are outside the scope of a given person's normal grammatical intuition and rely on cultural convention despite this).


I will now begin my exposition and re-exposition of what it means to understand poetry.

I first off stress that the apprehension of repetition and the intuitive sense that it is significant is something that, for the vast majority of people, is not dependent on any modal faculty that requires any effort to acquire. At the very least, it seems that the majority of people are able to appreciate rhythm, the effects of timed metre in music, end-line rhyming in poetry and literal repetitions of sentences, along with many other phenomena that rely on the perception of repetition in time. That this occurs implies a certain peculiarity of our mode of cognition. This peculiarity can be expressed by the idea of "continuity through difference" i.e. that we experience reality not simply as an immediate moment in time, but also through a dynamically generated 'memory' of a sequence through time, which might be considered the "working memory" ^1, through which our attention is drawn to and allowed to apprehend distinctions and similarities of structures as they appear. This apprehension is not completely universal with regard to all respects, some people experience difficult perceiving rhythm in the same way that most people are normally expected to [], and the nature of this kind of perception and what may bias a given being to take note of particular kinds of repetitive similarities seems to differ in different species of animals.

But let us assume as given that a particular person perceives these qualities and feels beats and 'immediate' repetitions. 


^1 The working memory as a scientific abstraction is something that I have brought up before. The kinds of phenomena that are held in the working memory are seemingly similar to that which are stored in the long term memory, which seems to be able to allow the recall of structures and relations between them in many modalities. Exactly how these various memories relate, how their storage is different or similar, and how this is substantiated through structure are open questions. At the very least, the faculties of memory seem to operate to allow me to compare and contrast the difference between experiences that I have have before and after developing both EVP and SGP, preserving the memory of when I lacked their perception to a certain extent in long term memory.
