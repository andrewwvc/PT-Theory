- Notes: With EVP, posesses "individualization in its presense, contrasted with that of other notes". I.e. Each note, despite having fuzzy bounderies, feels like a distinct note that is present and its presense can contrast with the presense of other notes. A note can be present as long as it either occurs at a distinctly different time as other notes, or overlaps in time but due to stream segemntation (caused by timbre, voice leading etc) is still percieced as having a seperate presence, and has enough of a 'speechlike' quality (as described by Heiner Ruland in chapter 1 of Expanding Tonal Awareness) to be perpercieved as a vocal presense equivilent to  the utterane of a sylible. This individualization creates a sense of distinction that is the basis for the perception of structure in western, tonal art music.
This can be contrasted with other forms of music, which can be more freeform in timbre, given their texture isn't required to posess the same structural qualities needed to mark out indivisualised notes and voice presenses.

- Color Forms: With VSF, posess "individualization in their presense, contrasted with that of other forms". All art that seems to posess "significant form" also seems to posess this restriction on how colors are used in its context, which I suspect serves a similar function to what the deliniation of notes in music serves in it, and may be necessary to allow a similar establishment of tension within visual art. Whether this is also sensed as a humanized, almost anthropomorthic presence within abstract form (like how the sense of voice provides empathetic qualities), I do not yet know. Like music, art with significant form can be contrasted with that which isn't beholden to it, which is free to make use of radiosity and all kinds of color bleeding which may allow it to better and more accurately portray real life scenes and the emotional effects.
