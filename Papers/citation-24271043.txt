Bever, Thomas & J Chiarello, Robert. (2009). Cerebral Dominance in Musicians and Nonmusicians. The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences. 21. 94-7. 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.94. Musically experienced listeners recognize simple melodies better in the right ea r than the left, while the reverse is true 
for naive listeners. Hence, contrary to previous reports, music perception supports the hypothesis that the left hemisphere
is dominant for analytic processing and the right hemisphere for holistic processing.
