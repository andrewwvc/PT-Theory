How might it be that the line breaks in Eliot's quartet here might register as being meaningful? To a certian extent, the line breaks as they are presented on the page visually may themselves be the main guide to a reader engaging with the poem, though they wil not show up in speach unless a reader deliberately stresses them through pauses. However, if we accept repetition as a driver for lineation, the sense of line forming, there may be some further clues to point us in the right direction. We can see that the first and third lines each end with 'time past' (with the line inbetween having 'time furture'), and the sixth and eighth with '-tion'. These are the clearest example of a direct pattern forming that matches the larger structural parrallels. We can also see something that we could be term 'inside-outside order swapping'. We see 'time past', then 'time future' ending the first and second lines, then the third starting with 'time future' and ending with 'time past'. We can also see a more tenacious and abstract form of this occur with 'present' at the ends of lines four and ten (which might be interpreted as a relatively wide spanning structure). What is important here is not so much how many sylables are in a line, but how specific words, sound patterns and meanings are used to create an architectural structure of parallals across and through them.
