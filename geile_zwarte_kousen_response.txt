Now this is interesting. You see, I am aware of cross serial dependencies being the reason for the non-context-free nature of certain languages' grammars and that this is something that generative linguistics acknowledges, which is why I noted the possibility of exceptions to the idea that language is strictly context-free. Not only do I not deny that humans are naturally capable of parsing things that escape the power of context-free structure, but I specifically believe that it is possible to develop a sense of parallelism that potentially makes this intuitively natural to process in certain cases. However, that there is this possibility doesn't yet change my personal fundamental view, which is that the language learning systems we possess, and which (almost) everyone specifically possesses as children, are specifically biased to learning and generalizing grammatical structures which are kept track of in a first-in last-out fashion. I have specific reasons for positing this, and intend to write a blog post that ties this in to the rest of my views in a more systematic way.

Now, I am open to evidence against this, which is why I am interested in speaking to people who natively speak dialects in which cross-serial dependencies exist. I'm interested in what it feels like to grapple with more complex examples of them, and also to what extent structures can be recursively embedded into them without feeling overly 'artificial'. I've also heard specifically that Swiss-German is supposed to be regarded as a more intellectual dialect, though I don't know what this means in practice, but I'm interested in getting a sense of what it is like to understand.
