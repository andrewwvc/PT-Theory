Pirah\'e3s who speak the language nativly from birth seem to be unable to learn other languages, like Portuguese - as the only member of the community who were able to learn Portuguese\~  are those who grew up learning an outside language. This suggests that, at the very least, that possibly the native Pirah\'e3s\~  have avoided the critical period for learning recursive language, and don't employ the mental patterns that would allow them to do so. This may be similar to the phenomena of Encompassing Voice and what it means to lack it (that certain 'candidate language' systems of signs are not perceived as 'narrowly voice-like'* unless this faculty is specifically developed later), which would imply that the Pirah\'e3s actually do not employ the 'language faculty' that processes speech-like structures, and hence may not even perceive human voice in the way that most cultures do. This is a somewhat wild hypothesis, but it is not all that unreasonable I feel and is worth investigating.}

\line Annihilation of Deep Structure:}{\cf1\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4
\~  I wish to note, that in proposing the concept of the Canonical Sequence, I intend the concept to illustrate what kinds of structures that EVA-SGNs might be able to comprehend if parts of a piece that relies on variant addition was altered to offer an EVA-SGN something that feels like it resolves, to the extant that that might be possible in the fragmented and abridged work that this would result in. I say this, because I want to make it clear that I am not saying that Canonical Sequences are necessarily really somehow the fundamental components of a piece, equivalent to a kind of linguistic deep structure, with Variant Structure being the surface structure, the thing that simply arises out of that but really is a representation of the core deep structure. I am aware that Leonard Bernstein has theorized something like this in his "Unanswered Question" lectures[1], with his conception of poetic super grammar also being a phenomena that enables existing musical structure to arise out of poetic transformations, something which we seem to have come up with independently (I had not watched through any of the lectures except for the first when I came up with the term, so it was a pleasant surprise when I saw that Bernstein had conjectured something with the same name). Though I have little doubt that Bernstein's intuition for the concept stemmed from similar feelings about the structure of poetry and its similarity with western art music, our takes on the idea are fundamentally different and I do believe that, in a certain sense, Bernstein's idea is wrong and that he would have the grace, were he still alive, to allow me to substitute my own understanding for his stab at it, given that I have deeper awareness of what music is like when someone precisely lacks the ability to transform its apparent linguistic structure through the poetic faculty that I propose individuals can unlock.}

Bernstein poses this deep structure, which is supposed to transform into the actual notes of the piece, as a kind of large scale projection of the substructures of the piece, repeated out as many times as necessary in order to make the piece as symmetrical as possible, so that each part clearly matches up with something else that directly corresponds to it, so that each section can be cleanly divided into a presentation of some musical material and a response to it. Now, this may be a useful way of thinking about music regardless, as a kind of exercise to see what music would be like if it were forced to "make more sense" by forcing everything to be more symmetrical so that it might more easily fit into a clean hierarchy, and I won't rebuke the idea. But I am saying that, on one hand, this is not something that makes a huge deal of sense structurally in the absence of poetic sensitivity (since no large scale hierarchical will take place regardless), and on the other, that I make no claims that Canonical Sequences as I posit them are deep structures in the sense that either Chomsky or Bernstein might mean or that they somehow represent something that somehow fundamentally captures the 'actual meaning' of a piece independent of its actual structure. I won't deny that they could be interpreted as some kind of deep or more fundamental structure in some way or in some framework that might be proposed, but at this time at least I will flatly reject that either my Canonical Sequences or Bernstein's proposed musical deep structure are such a thing and treat them both as "what if" mental exercises that serve to illustrate how certain types changes to a piece could affect its reception, what might be changed or preserved in the listener's interpretation of it and what this implies about the nature of super grammatical transformations.}

Variant construction naturally covers compositional techniques such as "phrase extension", elision, certain kinds of links between phrases and uses of interpolation. However, variant constructions are primarily an interpretive model, a way of defining and exploring how exactly it is that structures that would otherwise be limited to the expressive power of canonical sequences can be reinterpreted using poetic super grammar so that these additions and expansions of structural possibility can make sense. As such, variant construction concerns itself with a totality of structural possibilities that go beyond the techniques mentioned above, and allows the exploration of things like the addition of internal structure to canonical sequences that might affect how their phrasing is interpreted (which someone like Glenn Gould is particularly sensitive to). It also affects things like extra motivic grouping, like how patterns between groups (example of Bach C Major prelude from the WTC) can affect how they relate and form larger groups under super grammatical structure. Beyond this, it is also concerns with the resolution, or sublation, of ambiguities in the variant structure (reference Gould video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nZTgAGSajA and use WTC C minor fugue as example).}

Latent Activation vs Emergent Genesis:}{\cf1\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4
\~  This is the question of whether, in some sense, that the physical brain structures underlying SGP are simply dormant, or not using a particular type of connection in an active way, and it's a matter or some neural threshold being crossed in order to activate these otherwise latent structures, or if, conversely, certain kinds of cyclic/cross referencing structures form newly and then quickly cause the propagation and re-enforcement of similar kinds of structures over the course of days.

I do strongly suspect that latent activation is the case though. The reason being that, from reports of people who have temporarily changed their perception using hallucinogenic drugs, many have seemingly activated properties of perception that match up with my experience of EVP. Namely, they report things like "hearing the universe speaking to them" and "experiencing music as separate streams of instruments instead of a unified sound" while tripping. But at the same time, they also generally report these perceptual changes as being exclusive to the trip, i.e. that by the time their trip ends, these perceptual aspects return to their normal, baseline experience. This seemingly implies that, unlike my own case, a merely temporary elevation of certain kinds of neural activity can be triggered by drugs, causing what is likely to be the same threshold activation, but then falling back to a sub-threshold state after the effects wear off.}

It is important to consider the case where a person with a keen intellect, but without the ability to actively use the modes of perception (such as SGP) which allow the appropriate specific specialized components of the mind to, through the kinds of subconscious processing they perform, intuitively built up the forms and phenomenal feelings particular to those modes, could yet still look at the kinds of structures described by a cognitive framework such as this and try to work out things like what parts of a poem ought to have implicitly meaningful connections between them by puzzling them out, even if they themselves lack the appropriate intuition for this. Reading the previous sentence in itself probably gave you a significant test of your own ability to parse language (likely through UG [2]) and construct the appropriate meaning and structure out of it, which would likely be an incredibly difficult task were you to lack that and, instead, were simply given a list of ambiguous rules as to what grammatical constructs were likely valid and how to go word by word and figure out all the possible ways of parsing and extracting meaning out of them until you found something by trial and error that satisfied everything and made sense. The difficulty of, say a person lacking EVP trying to follow the structure of a fugue or similarly advanced tonal construct would be at least as difficult, if not vastly greater (as I know from experience trying to listen to such music prior to EVP activation).}

However, despite this difficulty, and my experience that certain kinds of imagination and aesthetic experience are simply not possible without the activation of the appropriate modes, I cannot dismiss the potential of the intellect and imaginative faculties in general (including various forms of memory, recall, and basic sequential processing [3] [4]). For example, a person without any special powers of perception may analytically notice that certain structural features and self-similarities exist in a given piece of music, even if they don't intuitively feel these structures have any inherent meaning in the way a person with more advanced modes of perception may be able to and hence won't feel their mind being triggered into building up these structures into "architectures of comparison". There is nothing preventing the intellect in general from manually processing these forms using any computable method that may yield some viable sense of structure, and is is precisely because of this that I believe that there is some importance in distinguishing the 'semi-automatic'* processes of select perceptual modes like EVP and SPG (among others), which mark out particular features in sound in similar ways in principal to how facial recognition does in connection with vision, from the more disengaged intellect which builds up its sense of patterns analytically, starting with smaller deliberate units of thought with less innate subconscious bias to particular structures.}

Considering the above discussed issue (that of distinguishing between different types and aspects of thought processes, analytical and automatic), we can discuss the idea of a 'structural basis process' (SBP) which we can try to figure out the grammatical and computational complexity of. To explain what I mean by a SBP, I will give two examples of them.}

The first will be a SBP of Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar (UG), concerning the basis of 'ordinary' (non-poetic, everyday) language. This may in principal be built up by defining a given language, in a general sense, by finding people who are agreed to speak a particular dialect of that language and are native speakers of it, having been immersed in it from a young age and being confident that that they can intuitively tell what spoken sequences of words might be considered valid grammatically sensible examples of the language, and asking them for their opinions on the validity of a wide range of example sentences, trying to exhaust the potential of that language's structure as fully as possible. For each language, to the extent there is strong general agreement among speakers with regard to these classifications, we can look at potential grammars derived in order to account for the language and consider what levels of computational power (in terms of the Chomsky hierarchy, or other methods of classifying the complexity of grammatical structure) are needed to parse them and classify them according to specific schema. This we will consider as a theoretical "ordinary language" SBP.}

A historical debate that has been running through the landscape of music is that of the value of 'pure' music, that which seemingly references only itself and the sounds and structures it consists of, and 'programmatic' music, music which references ideas and images outside of musical form and texture. In addition to these two apparent types of instrumental music (at least in terms of how they are intended to be listened to), there is also vocal music and musical drama, which naturally involve words, meaning, plot and actions and all things of this sort. There have been many music critics who have stressed the value of pure music over that of the programmatic style, considering the latter to be a kind of corrupted form, inferior to the more profoundly aesthetic nature of the former. A similar kind of thing had occurred in the world of the visual arts, with many critics explicitly valuing formal play of line and colors that need represent nothing over the tendency for artists to portray and reference objects and concepts from life. And yet, if you actually look at the thoughts and works of renowned composers and artists, even those most greatly championed by the purists and formalists, you will see they they themselves frequently place the greatest values on the works that they have produced which explicitly incorporate ideas and images which reference 'impure', non-formal things.}

Beethoven based his celebrated 6th around feelings for nature. The 3rd is explicitly evocative of the heroic. Even his 5th, which is often considered tightly musical in its use of theme, is something I feel is the most suggestive of a type of drama, to the extent that it implies a narrative of grappling with a dominating force, trying to reason with it, wondering what submitting to it would entail and ultimately resolving these feelings. But it is in his 9th that he introduced voice to the symphony, feeling that the human voice needed to break out of the instrumental texture to properly express where everything was leading to and that is the natural course that music should take. Wagner based his career around developing the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total artwork combining as many media as needed (or possible) to create its effects. In Van Gough we see a man who to his death might have placed an apparently inordinate level of value and effort in the thematic, empathetic and sentimental aspects of his Potato Eaters, while Picasso similarly had heavily political motivations in Guernica.}

I think I can help to resolve this though. Musical structure arises out of the perception of voice, and in my experience this is true regardless of the nature of the instruments as long as it does occur. Without perceiving any aspect of voice in melody, all grand formal and structural elements of music collapse and fail to resolve themselves in the mind of the listener. It is because all musical structure is founded in voice that encompass the listener's impression of it, and which is experienced through empathy with it, that it it only natural that composers might imagine music in these terms, such that words and drama feel they could and should arise out of the music. In this case, what would a 'pure' formal understanding of musical structure mean, if we accept that it arises to a great extent from the parts of the mind that allow language, poetry, empathy, emotion and meaning? We could say that it excludes things like the association with imagery 'outside' of the artwork implied by programmatic music (tone poems and the like), but I wish to comment on that. I believe I understand why many musicians caution against the association of certain kinds of music with imagery and concepts. There is a very reasonable fear that a listener may adjust their exceptions of the music according to these outside concepts, listening to the music only in terms of the things they have imported onto it and relying on them as a crutch in order to feel emotions instead of actively engaging with the structure of the music itself if they are able to do so and primarily feeling out where that leads first. How many people perpetually associate the end of the William Tell overture with horse racing and cavalry regardless of what happens in the actual opera?}

If thematic structure, as a canonical structure, is based on the same cognitive basis as sentences (the effective equivalent to UG), why should SGP and variant structures be required on top of this to enable center embedding to have meaningful structural significance in music, given that ordinary language allows recursive center embedding? In a certain respect, I don't know. There are significant differences between how the two are formed, themes are essentially intonation draped over rhythmic beats in time that responds to echos of itself, as opposed to based on words with meaning grounded from other sources forming an intelligible meaning out of their relation in language. Themes themselves can actually be extended and embellished, just not in the same ways that provide the structural significance and multi-layered (within a single voice) parallels. So this embellishment does, in a sense, provide hierarchical structure, enabling a kind of center embedding, but, in contrast to variant structure, the way this occurs in a given instance of a theme is independent of other instances of the the theme, so changes to a theme instance won't have the same large scale impact on structures that are horizontally parallel and how they build up that variant structures do for SGPAs, and the possible structural extensions are more limited. In short, the hierarchical possibilities are limited to a local level, via of insertion and deletion of notes between others, and generally have an impact on a more limited scale, with their impressions contrasting mostly with the themes close to them temporally and directly responding to them or in a similar position relative to the start of an obviously similar section at best, but otherwise having no large scale impact on structure. While the possibility of variant structures allows elements to build and affect hierarchical structures at an arbitrarily large scale that consume and parallel each other on many different levels.}

}}, and later supplemented\~  this with a university course in Japanese. However, there were certain more advanced aspects of learning the language and gaining an intuitive sense of its structure largely from experience, as opposed to being built up through analytical\~  learning, that arose largely from what I believe are a combination\~  of the built in biases of Universal Grammar and their interaction with the structure of actual Japanese phrases as I encountered them. The one example that stands out the most here is the experience of learning how the word }{\cf1\fs28\dbch\af4\afs28\rtlch \ltrch\dbch
\u12300\'3f\u12418\'3f\u12387\'3f\u12392\'3f\u12301\'3f }{\cf1\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4
(motto) interacts with sentences. Now, in first learning it, I was simply told that it means 'more' in a general sense, but I did not learn it in term of what grammatical\~  part of speech it was "supposed to be" and no attempt was made to explicitly distinguish it from the English word 'more'. However, in learning Japanese I did try to avoid learning things by first translating them to English through particular conceptions of translation rules, I instead\~  strove to learn things by understanding them holistically\~  in Japanese, by learning direct association of statements and how they relate to meaning, retraining\~  myself to think directly\~  in Japanese in the process. In doing so, my understanding of the word }{\cf1\fs28\dbch\af4\afs28\rtlch \ltrch\dbch
\u12300\'3f\u12418\'3f\u12387\'3f\u12392\'3f\u12301\'3f }{\cf1\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4
progressed in a particular way. It started out by understanding it as something that modifies the immediately next word or object that follows it, but I found that, from context, it was largely used to describe an increase or demand to increase the magnitude of a verb, eventually feeling that the word modifies and\~  attaches to\~  verbs, with intermediate words in between the 'motto' and the verb separating the two delaying the 'resolution'\~  that results when the 'tension' created by the motto is fulfilled\~  by an \~  appropriate verb that makes sense in context. This was not something I learnt analytically, rather it turned out such that when I encounter\~  }{\cf1\fs28\dbch\af4\afs28\rtlch \ltrch\dbch

I don't think if it as meaning anything in particular until I reach a verb that seems to sensibly\~  satisfy it, and until that point I perceive\~  a 'motto-tension' that has yet to resolve into anything\~  proper. This ends up interacting\~  with another aspect of Japanese in a particular way. In Japanese, you can generally describe a given noun by shoving another sentence in front of it. However, you can also do this while having additional structure in front of that sentence, such as a 'motto' that, instead of resolving in the verb of initial 'inner' sentence (which might not make sense), carries through that whole sentence to resolve in the 'outer' sentence in the second\~  }{\cf3\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4

Specifically, the listener will not be able to empathize with the music or perceive it's forms and tones as expressing empathetic or ethical affect. The music will not yet express redemption, dramatic or dialectic conflict or things of that nature. These things require the impression of voice to properly convey them.

Expressions of themes become 'emotional objects', sentences and utterances that speak and respond to each other, which become subjects of sympathy. Each voice will feel like it has its own specific home key, which the listener will keep track of for each individual. However, this style of polyphonic listening will conflict with the perception of harmonies between the individualized voices, which can only be overcome in a particular way.}

With SGP and EVP both active though, a different, more synthetic kind of listening becomes possible. In this mode, the strict need for individualization dissipates, the voices can merge together and become less distinct, allowing a richer expressive power from harmony and counterpoint. In this mode, the voices are still there, and can be perceived individualized as such, but there is no longer a need to rely strictly on that individualization that was otherwise necessary. Your subconscious will keep track of all the various possible mixed and matched interpretations of the vocal lines, letting you allow the music to wash over you without having to put in the conscious energy to acknowledge all all the voices individually. As such, the voices are freer to mix roles more readily, a voice in a high register can pick up and continue a theme from a lower register or make a burst of melody that harmonizes on plays on another, and you will simply notice and be aware of all this activity even if you don't exert great effort in concentrating on this, as a EV}{\cf1\b\ab\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4

no longer need to perform this act of concentration, perceiving tonal structure automatically, they will often find themselves naturally and even absentmindedly perceiving a diatonic\~  tonal structure in music that doesn't require it, as long as it also doesn't explicitly prohibit this. Most pop music will have such a structure, it is not actually tonal in a proper sense and can be listened to and understood by those without any sense of diatonic tonality or structure, and even those who do perceive it with diatonic tonality should be able to tell that it doesn't actually progress thematically or demand any specific resolution or need to return to a home key. This kind of music can be distinguished from 'fully' atonal styles of music (like 12 tone serialism) which deliberately withhold from the mind this tonic seeking ability. So, here, we get a sense of why even pieces that aren't based around a particular tonal resolution are often considered to be tonal by those who simply find a tonal center impressed on them while listening when their harmonies suggest a particular tonality. I suspect that people who don't hear music tonally carry there musical ideas over into their own practice when theory is imposed on them, and confuse melodies and harmonies based around particular scales and how they shape expectations (which is an interesting topic in itself) with tonality proper (which I propose is fundamentally concerned with tonal centers, their perception and structures formed around them). I feel that these two fundamentally related issues are often confused with each other unnecessarily, and I hope that my suggestions lead to more people understanding this and ultimately clearing up these confusions.}

s\~  seeming have to commit instances of a theme to long term memory and listen to a piece several times to properly follow the thematic material it is made up of, and even then their structural understanding will be fundamentally limited in certain ways, whereas gaining SGP allows you to 'hear through' a piece the first time in one go if you are particularly receptive to it and have experience with and understand its idiom and what structural techniques it is likely to use. Without SGP, the idea of following the structure of a substantial movement will feel like a monumental and barely possible feat, while with it such a thing likely won't even feel like it is really all that much of an accomplishment. SGPs won't generally be able to understand most of the structural complexities and interpretive details on a first listen, especially if the piece is particularly dense, but for many style of music they should generally be capable of following a general overview of the structure and pick up and follow the themes and how they are 'canonically' and 'variantly' transformed, given that they are familiar with other works that use similar techniques and have picked up how to interpret them. It will also be much more reasonable for an SGPA to pick up the flow of a new piece and hone in on its tonal structure even when jumping into it at a random point in time and also keep track of where they are within its structure and how it is likely to continue on and end.}

I need to add this here in order to clarify something. While I have given a few examples of what counts as a canonical transformation, what I have mentioned is not exhaustive. What is important is that canonical transformations specifically lack the meaningful structural extension and embedding that variant transformations enable. I have mentioned that among some things that canonical transformation are transpositions. But even so you might have seen that, with some of the examples, like Beethoven's 7th, the sense of theme was preserved as long as its form (beat pattern, including note lengths and rests) was preserved. It's also possible to perceive something as a thematic transformation if the form differs, but the melodic intervals are relatively preserved. Because of this I want to explore what may or may not affect the sense of what may make a potential candidate feel like an instance of a thematic transformation of another.}

If we look at transpositions, they can be considered to be 'real' if they preserve all the same proportions between the pitches of each succeeding note (i.e. a 5th remains a 5th, a semitone up remains a semitone up from the previous note). But they seemingly don't have too be. They may change the individual relations between the pitches, and the general sense of the theme being a transformation of another can still be maintained in the mind. This may even be necessary if the composer wants to avoid the sense of the music moving its key center. The idea of transposition may then be generalized to something more abstract. We could consider the an exact repetition of a phrase to be a kind of 'identity transposition', that is perceptually the closest and least varied, while considering more radical modifications of the theme to be more distant kinds of transformations. Note transpositions that are 'real' are more distant than exact repetitions, 'tonal' transpositions that more freely vary the note values but which preserve the overall shape of the theme - which parts move up in pitch from the previous note and which move down, could be seen as being even more distant still, but can still be perceived as canonical thematic transforms. Going even further, themes can seemingly be 'flattened', but being reduced to a series of tones with the same pitch value, preserving only the relative length and timing of each note. Other kinds of transformations, such as those which preserve the melodic intervals, but which alter the 'shape' of the theme by changing the duration of notes and rests, may also be considered distant, in a way that's different in kind. Changes of volume, timbre, register etc. may also considered close and 'stable' transformations.}

There may be cases where what seems like an instance of a transformation that could only be covered by variant addition is actually an instance of canonical transformation produced by a combination of extension and embellishment, and hence will still make sense to a SGPN despite the same passage being also potentially perceived as a parallel extension of the theme under variant addition.}

There is a possibility that the 'Third Eye', or the Ajna Chakra, is itself a combination of Poetic Integration/SGP and Clive Bell's significant form. My experience of activating SGP is similar to that of how some practitioners describe the methods used to awaken the third eye, with meditative practice that focuses on the brow (an experience I find similar to how I feel when listening to intoned music) resulting in an awakening of particular kinds of visions that I believe I have had. In the dark, I have seen visual patterns arising that corresponding to the angels/elves/spiritual beings described by many mystics and psychonaughts, circular 'eye' patterns with 'crystalline' transforming\~  \~  geometric projections.

Recent search has shown that when students strong in a particular modality have their education tailored to that style, while avoiding others that they are weaker in, it doesn't necessarily benefit them in the long run. This makes a lot of sense, as while teaching to a student's strengths may accelerate their learning in some ways, I predict that practicing active concentration on non-dominant modalities can and will result in them becoming stronger and enabling thought processes that might otherwise have been inaccessible, even if practicing this is initially difficult. I'd rather advocate that the strengths and weaknesses individuals be recognized, and that both their strengths be taken advantage of, and their weaknesses worked on to transform them into new strengths.}

EVP: Apprehend themes in ways which like speaking a sentence who's intent (questioning, command, compassionate understanding, responding in turn with an answer) is indicated through intonation. 'Commas' can be added, which results in the feeling of the 'sentence'/melody being suspended for a short time, but the natural 'resolution' to this must be immediately tacked on.}

The degree to which the conventions of academia that have lead scientists and mathematicians to write in stilted ways that draw them away from elucidating the thought processes that resulted in their work, instead concealing them behind the formal convention of the objective discoverer of theories and collector of data, is unfortunate and shameful. In high school I was told that authors of scientific papers ought to detail their finding passively, saying "it was found that" rather than tell how it was that they actually found what they did. This is something that I have always resented.}

Gould has said a lot about the structural elements of Bach's music.Especially notable is his feeling for the 'primordial forms', which I believe are the 'ambiguously' overlapping block structures which arise from variant addition. Note that Gould also mentions "not being there" in his experience of Bach's music, implying that his experience involves that of self-less timelessness.}

After saying all this there is something important I will have to say, given that in part it was a significant reason behind me writing this article, which is that I am well aware now that I am very likely not the first to uncover these particular mental phenomena. There is currently a multi-million dollar industry that is rapidly gaining popularity in Asia which is based around the understanding that education methods can be developed specifically to train what I have mentioned above and activate these otherwise dormant perceptive abilities in order to transform a person's perception of the world and deeply enhance their capacity to process information and understand ideas, with the explicit goal of creating child geniuses. They seem to have independently developed Focus Switch Induction techniques of their own, that are largely based around blindfolding subjects and having them perform various activities. However, this industry is currently not in vogue in the west and is not taken seriously in any scientific community, given what it practices and how it justifies this. This is something I hope to change, though that will be dealt with further in other posts.}

Along this line of thought, while canonical sequences may be considered part of some kind of formal language, it is more fruitful here in my view to consider the mental process of assimilating linguistic constructs as a continuous, ongoing and organic process, rather than something that results in a final, well defined set of constructs that either each are or are not valid as part of a single formal system.}

It is still possible for a theme that starts at the same point the theme preceding it ended to be a response that is also a canonical sequence but in a different voice, as opposed to a direct response continuing in the same voice. Otherwise, if it is in the same voice, it will be perceived as a kind of running enjambment (where the whole subsequent theme is perceived as an extension of the resolution) that requires SGP.}

Tragic art, and the general effect of it on the human subject, as explored by philosophers such as Aristotle, Hegel and Nietzsche, is not specifically dependent on the modal faculties EVP or SGP. Specific tragic artworks which rely on these faculties may not be comprehensible to those without them, but the overall effect experienced, of the portrayal contrasting forces in dynamic conflict resulting in the 'cathartic' effect experienced as ecstatic compassion/horror, is not something restricted to a specific medium (though the use of many media can enhance the experience). So, for instance, the drama of a Henrik Ibsen play can produce such an effect, as the drama doesn't rely on excessively poetic language to deliver itself.}

It seems to not be the case. But it is not, then how is it that the idea of 'moments' (in a general sense) are inferred or believed to constitute phenomonal experience? This is similar to, and partially constitutes "Plato's problem", of knowledge of seeming absolutes. I do not believe that "the forms" are a sufficient explanation of this in principle. Our sense of 'line' and 'straightness' may arise in part from the way pathways leading from our eyes present edges to the structures that constitute our mind; and along with this our seemingly innate sense of 'perfect equality' may present itself. The impression of a 'moment' in time (as a specific abstraction from a more generalized sense of moment) may be related to this. The sense that we can and do experience the world through individual moments, as opposed to aggregations or integrations of them may be understood through the impression a static image gives to us, providing a sense of stillness that seems to be in principal equivalent to that of a frozen moment, were we actually capable of such an experience; similarly, a dot may seem to approximate an ideal point, though it actually occupies a certain area and acts as a symbol for it.}

One thing that has been said about the nature of our eyesight is that, while the center of our field of vision, the part projecting onto the forvea, appears clear and dense in detail, the peripheral parts of our field of view are in contrast "actually blurry". This particular statement is made because, apparently, we aren't aware of this "blurriness" most of time - instead, the brain supposedly 'tricks' up into "thinking that our vision really is continuously clear", falsely giving the impression that most of our visual field is in fact 'not blurry', despite that we will still choose to look directly at something when we want to properly see it in detail.}

However I see significant issue with this. The problem is that I perceive a significant difference in the 'fuzziness' that characterizes actually blurry impression of objects when they are perceived through the forvea, and the seemingly different quality of vision when things are perceived through parts of the eye that simply provide less detail. You could say that things are "really blurry, but you simply don't notice this most of the time" on the periphery, but I don't think this is an accurate description of vision at all. When you perceive that something is blurry, it is generally because you are looking at it dead on, receiving a lot of information about it, and specifically seeing that parts of it smear together or otherwise look fuzzy in detail. You can even specifically see this quality of blurriness, in contrast to non-blurriness, in your periphery if you look at an object so that it is outside the center of your vision yet keep your focus at the same distance as the object (resulting in no perceived blurriness), and then subsequently focus on an object that's further away (resulting in blurriness). The object, when 'in-focus' will not be perceived as comparatively blurry. Instead, it simply seems to be less detailed (though some added impression of its detail may be caused by a memory of what it looked like when it appears in the center of vision).}

To further elaborate on this idea of detail-impression, and what happens what parts of our vision lack detail, we can look as what happens when we notice the nature of visual impression that occurs when something is positioned at the blind-spot of one of our eyes (when the other eye is blocked and we specifically align our sight so that an object 'disappears' when this spot passes over it). You can try this right now to see what it is like. You should notice that, rather than seeing a 'blank' spot (filled with either darkness or a perceived complete absence of vision), that the dead part of your vision is 'filled in' and continuous with the rest of your visual field despite no specific visual information being provided to it from your eye. Normally, this would be provided by your other eye, but we can see via this how the visual impressions in a given part of our visual field can be perceived as being filled-in and continuous despite having relatively low information content provided to them, without this resulting in any sense that the low detail area is blurry.}

We could also use this idea to better understand what occurs at the edges of our field of vision. Rather than stop abruptly, it gradually looses detail, so that at the edges it becomes something closer to a vague light-color field, though definite shapes and movement are still apparent to a lesser extent.}

As well, a thinking being that 'completely imagined' another being in its totality, simulating all of its operations would effectively emulate it, yet without necessarily integrating the qualities of its thought into the host (i.e. someone imagining the process of someone thinking about a red square wouldn't necessarily imagine a red square themselves). However, it is not really obvious whether or to what extent an embedded thinking entity, with its own thoughts, would retain a separateness of consciousnesses if it were more deeply integrated into the host's brain i.e. that instead of simply supplying 'inputs' and 'outputs' to a small number of neurons, the internal mechanisms that it uses to process things were directly connected to those that process similar things on the larger host brain. Co-joined twins connected at the brain have been able to share thoughts in this way, so this is clearly possible, but the question here is to what extent would it be\~  }{\cf1\i\ai\rtlch \ltrch\loch\fs28\loch\f4

Neural Style Transfer. The lack of philosophy and aesthetic experience has lead many computer scientists to have excessive confidence on the power of AI to replace the creative power of artists, since, understandably, they do not understand what it is exactly that artists aim to create themselves, and assume their own intuitions are sufficient to judge the resulting quality of the art produced. The lack of the capacity for AI programmers to create a evaluation function that corresponds to aesthetic judgement is generally apparent, and the assumption that the 'good', which is the ultimate criteria of art, is strictly numerically evaluateable is in itself a completely unfounded presumption, which would make such a function unviable for anything less than a broad, course sense of artistic value, even if that could be captured (which would require a proper model of what the human mind considers valuable and all the difficulties that would imply).}

An artistically minded person may say that a mechanically minded person, an engineer, may be emotionally impoverished and hence imply that they are untrustworthy in matters of the soul. However, while there may be some truth to this, it is important to examine why this may be so. The artistically inclined person may assume the mechanically incline to be in some sense like, like them, but, due to their focus on the systematic rather then the emotional, their sense for what is beyond the systematic is dulled in comparison. While there may be some truth to this, this viewpoint may discount the possibility of there being a fundamental difference of perception/imagination/intuition due to a fundamental difference in mental faculties, which naturally results in the two different kinds of people diverging due to their perceptions of reality, which ought to naturally result in different inclinations. As such, it is important for both kinds of people to be more sympathetic to each other either way, and to empathize with why there might be such a misunderstanding rather than commit to a premature judgement.}

With regard to Style Transfer and what it may mean for creativity, it makes sense that human creativity is a combination of imagination/inspiration, which in large part consists of transformations of material that the artist/imaginer has been exposed to empirically, combined with the native ability of the person to aesthetically evaluate the image being composed. The combination of faculties makes sense, in that it sheds on light on why many artists may generally find it difficult to cognize and produce wholly original styles without some kind of model or movement to work from.}

"He unleashed his anger," is a phrase that inspires more real, dynamic activity through vital imagination in me than all the other metaphorical phrased used as examples in the second chapter of Metaphor Wars. I am inspired to feel that anger takes on the role of an animal, as something that someone has specifically willingly unchained to allow it freedom outside the control that they would otherwise exercise over it. It's this specific imaginative regard for it, as opposed to the simple acceptance of the exclamation being that "of someone acting violently in their anger" that a 'dead' apprehension of the metaphor would imply, that seems to allow me to feel the engagement that I feel is characteristic of the vitalistic imagination. The other metaphors in comparison feel 'stuffed' to me, there is nothing in them that would allow the power of my own imagination to revive them.}
