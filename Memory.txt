One of the factors which potentially limits the inquiry here is the nature of memory. Memory is limited and subject to flaws and things can be forgotten or falsely remembered. In recalling my own memories of music, heard before I gained a given modal faculty in order to compare that memory to what I hear afterwards, I employ memory in order to do so, so it stands to reason that it is a good idea to examine it in order to understand how I can make such comparisons.

One of the chief flaws of memory is the fact that memories can be overwritten, meaning that a second viewing/listen of something that differs in slight ways from the original, an attempt to explain and embellish it, or even the simple act of recalling something without additional stimulus, can alter the original memory. So given this is the case, how confident can I be that my ability recall old memories of music has not been been altered by the process of examination and comparison? The answer is, that in general, I do experience this overwriting of memory, and for each piece the initially clear memories which enable a direct comparison of feeling are gradually replaced by vaguer and more abstract ones as I continue to feel out and analyse the music. I can still get a general sense of what it is that EVP and SGP have given to me, from both the comparisons I have been able to make and the recognition of the specific feelings that underlie and signify the experience brought by each respective faculty.

However, each time I listen to a piece which I heard before the gaining of a faculty, but which I had not listened to since, I am able to compare the contrast between the memory and the experience in a very clear and vivid way, with a strong impression of the differences impacting me in the act of listening. Because of this, after gaining SGP, I deliberately choose to not listen to a number of pieces, and slowly worked my way through them over the course of a year so that I cloud feel the specific impact on structure as I worked on analysing it further.
