Can certain people imagine things that others cannot? I will make the claim that yes, this is the case, and this should not be surprising. Mathematicians can imagine mathematical objects Do certain people have "forms of imagination" that others do not? Once again, I make the claim that this is so. This will be a bit more controvercial, so I will lead by example. A blind person, who has never experienced sight, will in most cases be unable to directly imagine what vision is like without comparison to other senses.

If someone told you that it may be possible for you to develop new forms of imagination, whole new areas of thought that they had never before been capable of, you'd be right to be skepticle of such a claim. The idea that various kinds of brain plasticity might be possible is not new, it is well known that blind people can develop acute sensitivity in their other senses, and those who have injured parts of their brains can compensate for the damage, to various extents, by having other portions that previously performed other functions take over.
