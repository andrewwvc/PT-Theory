What percentage of people in various populations respectively have UVP and SVP?

Can reliable methods of testing for each aspect be developed?

Is UVP necessary to develop beforehand before SVP is activated, or is SVP possible without UVP?

If SVP without UVP is possible, how common is it compared to UVP without SVP?


Innate Unlocking vs Critical Expansion:

When SGP is activated, is it because there are innate, existing strutures that aren't currently being used in that particular way which need to have certain conections unlocked in order to allow the kinds of pattern detection SGP enables (innate hypophosis), or is is the case that, in learning various patterns and the connections between them, perception of patterns based around hierarchical context emerges out of neural structure in a way that is learned, but that requires neural structures capable of subconsiously working with higher levels of computation (and hence the Chomsky hierarchy) to arise in certain parts of the brain?
