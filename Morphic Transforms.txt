Here, I'd like to bring up a particular concept I've just concieved, which I call the morphic transform. This kind of transformation relates to how musical themes flow through the hinge/break structures, which I brought up in variant construction part 3. Specifically, morphic transforms concern themselves with the development of thematic material in such a way that, instead of progressing through the structure of a single canonical sequence and ending at the end pont of that particular sequence, or doign the same but with repeats of subsections, they flow through a 'hinge' which breaks that part of the structure, and instead of continuing with a repeat of a part of that theme such that the melody concides with the implicitly 'regular' structural aspects of the theme, the melodic aspects are theaded through a structure that diverges in a significant way. This is a lot of abstraction to digest, and I beleive that properly explaining this will be very difficult, as I barely understand how such structures form or how meaningful it might be to even attempt to subsume them under a formal system of generative rules. But having said that, the concept itself it important conceptually as a way of reconciling the idea of a canonical sequence as I have experienced it (1) with the actual musical forms that comprise existing published compositions.

(1) Which is very important to remember, as I would not bother to propose the idea of the canonical sequence without experiencing a state of consiousness where I was limited to experiencing linguistic structures and transformations that conform to it, as opposed to the further structures I experience now. It is mostly because of the grounding in direct experience that I believe the construct has real value and deserves attention beyond being a hopeful theoretical excercise. This is good reason to justify attempts to reconcile the idea with the actual 'surface structure' of more complex compositions.
