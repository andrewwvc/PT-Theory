I understand why you feel the way to you and don't blame you for feeling that my work is in need of better justification, and I want to correct that issue. I do want to make it clear at this point that I am not sure of what extent my experiences will generalise to other people, and so you should treat most of what I'm saying as hypothesies which have yet to properly be put to the test. I have though, despite this, been writing in such a way that presumes there is more force to what I say than I have provided solid evidence for, but I basically just don't want to bother *couching* everything I say overly tentative language all the time.



Anyway, I welcome criticism and have no issue with people pointing out potential problems with what I'm trying to do, as difficult as that may be given how different people's preferences, experiences and ways of viewing the world are.

If you are sceptacle, I understand, as that is reasonable at this point. But I must object to claims that what I am saying is simply empty, as I hope that I have shown you that this is not that case and that I am making a number of specific preditions, which I am willing to weaken or disregard if there is strong enough evidence against them.


Evidence:

- Emcompassing voice is supported by research showing that professional level musical training is associated with linguistic processing of music.

- Vitalistic Imagination is supported by - metaphor

- SGP predicts that EVP is not necessarily sufficiant to allow a person to perceive grouping structure, contrary to what is predicted by the GTTM.

-Likewwise, I predict that a lack of ability to percieve grouping structure should correlate to a lack of ability to properly perceive meter in verse poetry.
