Consider the nature of causality, assuming that physics is symmetric through time. The direction of causality would then seem to arise or emerge from a source of 'order' (providing some kind of local constrainy on entropy), rather than form a more fundumental law of reality.

Consider initially, a set of paticles (or, if particles are too high an abstraction, some more fundumental model of reality) randomly existing in some undefined extent of space, which I willo call the Random universe. Knowing nothing else about it, there may be no reason to assign any causal direction to time in a given direction, the past will seem to 'cause' the future as much as the future causes the past. Under this kind of model, we may see our own universe as being constituted similarly, though with a 'source' of order that seems to result in a universe in which we percieve time as flowing from the perspective of individual entities within it, and in which certain orders of activity (i.e. waves projecting outwards from a source, as opposed to being spontaniously projected inwards to a focal point from the environment) seem more natural and orderly.

Imagine, in contrast to either example, a kind of Local Order universe, one in which there is at some point in time, for whatever reason, some object or unusually dense collection or particles which are condensed into a solid object. Imagine we know nothing about its context, except that its environment is otherwise equivilent to the Random universe.
