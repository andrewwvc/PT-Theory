Here I will discuss the topic of pre-emptive conception. In the preface I brought up this particular issue, that I seem to have come up with certain ideas or aspects of ideas which match up to those which have also been invented by others who have written similar works, and that this, if my particular claims are true, would provide some support for these ideas, though they have still given confidence to me personally that what I describe in this work has substance that matches up with the same phenomena as experienced by other people. Now, again the issue with this is a matter of faith, I have no way of showing that it is the case that I have actually come up with these ideas and conceptions independently, as I claim, and so I can only hope that what else I have to offer gives my readers enough reason to believe me when I ask for this small amount of trust. This section deals with the general role of pre-emptive conceptions in this work and allows me to treat them as a general topic.

The first example of such a pre-emptive conception that I want to discuss is that of the development of grouping structure as an aspect of variant structure. When I first tried to describe variant structure, my only knowledge of grouping structure was gained from a cursory reading of the Wikipedia article  [NOTE: This turns out to be insufficient, there was an additional article which presented illustrations of the structures using Bach and Mozart pieces that made things clearer] on the GTTM at the time. As such my impression of Lerdahl and Jackendoff's conception of it was that of an exhaustive partition of the musical structure such that each and every note was part of one, and only one, group at any given hierarchical level, as opposed to having looser constraints that permitted the possibility of overlaps within a level. However, in apprehending variant structure, I immediately suspected that it was the case that what I identified as the basic structural unit of Variant Addition or Variant Folding (the elements which sequentially parallel each other) was in fact what Lerdahl and Jackendoff had called grouping structure. At this point, I assumed that what I was identifying in describing overlap was something that the GTTM did not explicitly deal with, but continued to use this structural possibility anyway since my goal was to describe my own intuitions, rather than try to shoehorn existing theory into my descriptions. So, when I finally got to sit down and read A Generative Theory of Tonal music, and found that elision and overlap were actually explicitly described and accounted for and worked within the GTTM in ways I had identified, it acted as an affirmation that what I was describing was actually the phenomena I had thought it was.

So, keeping this in mind, I want to run through the total process I went through in discovering that SGP allowed the apprehension of grouping structure.

- I started off without SGP and seemingly without apprehension of grouping structure. I didn't 'know' at the time that I was incapable of perceiving it, but rather, I simply tried to read an article about the GTTM in an attempt to understand it and found that this seemed to be difficult; I could not intuitively see how my own experience of musical structure was reflected in the GTTM and specifically found that the specific things described by grouping structure, illustrated by analysis of specific pieces in the article, were not aspects of musical structure that I would have independently thought to be meaningful i.e. my intuitions then did not predict them. However, I did not immediately assume that this indicated that there existed cognitive faculties that I did not currently possess, I simply thought that the structures described were possibly subtle and complex in ways that I just happened to not comprehend, and that more study (both of theory and music) and contemplation might shed light on what I was missing (though of course I couldn't completely rule out that I happened to lack another 'faculty').

- The day I developed SGP I recall thinking that “I finally understand music”, i.e. that is seemed apparent that the structures that I had been searching for had finally appeared in my mind. I couldn't be completely sure of this at first of course, but I strongly felt that this was the case, because it seemed to explain both why there was so much I could not understand in the actual listening of music and what it was in explanations of musical structure (such as that of the GTTM) that I had so far been unable to comprehend, insofar as it did not match up to the intuitions that I had had up until that point. This was largely based off my memory of the explanations I had read, it would be over a year until I actually read the GTTM and essentially confirmed that its structures (specifically grouping structure) did match up with what I was able to newly intuit.

- I later decided to write the articles on variant construction, still not having either read the GTTM, or having any awareness of the literature on music theory which did discuss structures involving elision/overlap etc. or hint at how this might be involved in grouping structure. As such, I independently conceived of those structural elements from my own personal intuition, as they were undeniably part of what I called variant structure from my own perspective.

- I then subsequently researched more literature on the analysis of musical structure, finding that what I had come up with was actually explicitly dealt with, both in the GTTM, where it is considered a special case of grouping structure, and elsewhere.

This total process, to my mind, shows strong evidence that not only my own intuitions do happen to match up with those of existing music theory, but that this in its own way demonstrates reason to be more confident of the discreet nature of the modal faculty (SGP) which seems to have given rise to this structural phenomena. For it was the comparative lack of ability to wrap my mind around these structures, even when they were explicitly described to me in examples [use both the GTTM Mozart k. example and the Bach inverted variations example when you can find them], and then, later, coming to naturally and intuitively 'rediscover' them in my own cognitive processes, not only as they were described to the extent that I was able to understand them, but in ways which matched up to the more expansive total description of them that I was then only partially aware of, that provided me with an even greater confidence that what I was doing was well founded.


This whole example also acts as a model for the more general topic of pre-emptive conceptions and their use as a means of personal validation, of which there are several other examples that I will draw attention to in this work. Of course, their use as personal validation only meaningfully demonstrates the solidity of the idea in question to myself, the reader is free to retain their own scepticism, though I still ask them to acknowledge the degree to which this might in principle demonstrate meaningful evidence in favour of these ideas.


A second example is that of the data that has come out of various studies concerning the selective involvement of brain areas associated with the processing of voice  with that of music. Notably, it is specifically among people with extensive musical training that it seems to be the case that they make use of areas of the brain which are also involved in language processing when dealing with music [], and on top of this, connections between additional areas seems to be recruited when recursively embedded hierarchical structures are involved[]. Conversely, it's generally the case in these studies that people who specifically have no formal musical training tend to little to no show signs of this increased language correlated activity while listening to instrumental music (though this is not always the case, and demonstrations of people without explicit formal training having these abilities and showing indications of linguistic processing seemingly have been made[]).


While many existing studies provide data that positively supports my thesis, it would be dishonest to exclude studies that might actually pose evidence that I am seemingly unable to explain. The chief example of this would be what is popularly known as The Mozart Effect. The original study from which this term was coined involved a number of college students who, after listening to a recording of a piece of music by Mozart, ended up with temporarily increased  visio-spacial processing ability. Now, this doesn't directly refute the core of my hypotheses, but it does seemingly go against my personal experience, in which listening to complex music actively fights against my ability to process things using spacial processing techniques. As such, I would predict that such listening would, if anything, degrade spacial ability in the short term, rather than enhance it.
