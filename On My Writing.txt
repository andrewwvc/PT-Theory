For the most part, I am not happy with the way I have written most of the content here. I would love to be able to write better, make things clearer and add more spice and dramatic flourish to it all. But that nature of what I am writing about make this very difficult. When sitting down to write, I have to be constantly on guard, otherwise I might unknowingly contradict something I wrote earlier which was stated in a way I don't directly recall and in doing so retroactively make that earlier piece more unclear. On top of this, it may turn out that in the course of working out my ideas, I end up inadvertedly figuring out a counter-example to the specifics of a previous conception which requires me to go back and redefine my previous terms, which then necessitates that I go back and potentially rework everything that might be implicitly dependent on or related to that prior conception. So I weary of having to do this, and introducing extravagent flurishes runs a risk I'd rather avoid if I can. I would actually love to write more of this in a way that is less acedemic sounding and speaks more to personal expereince otherwise, but I need to first be as careful as possible in order to avoid unnecessary confusion in crafting this framework, which in this case means an excessively analytic tone. I know I ought to be capable of writing articles that are more flowing, but here I don't believe that would be worthwhile.
