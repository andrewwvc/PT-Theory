A person without 'secondary imagination' naturally thinks in cliche and "dead metaphor". There's nothing actually bad or shameful about this per se and I mean no insult by it, as this is just how the mind of a person without SGP operates - they simply do not have the process of imagination that would animate metaphor and bring it to life as an independent entity in the same way an SGPA would. Metaphor isn't even really 'dead' to them in the first place, as they couldn't really concieve of it as being alive in a manner that would allow them to percieve such a contrast unless they were to develop the appropriate faculty themselves. In the same way that a person is likely to think  of a decaying mouse as being 'dead' before they would do the same to a lump of crystal, a person who has never expereinced turns of phrase as being metaphorically animate won't feel there is anything wrong with using their tombs to construct new houses.
