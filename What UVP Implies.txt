The nature of Uniform Voice Perception (UVP) has certian implications for the nature of how the perception of musical structure takes place within the human mind. Notably, the following aspects of music are intrinsicly tied together in mutually arising out of UVP (or, at the very least, UV-like perception related to music).

- Perception of 'tonality', being 'in a key', having a need to return to a 'tonic' (all of these are essentially equivilant)
- Perception of 'themes' (as opposed to just melody) and particular kinds of transformation of those themes being musically meaningful.
- Perception of 'voices', 'voice leading' and related phenomina, and without the 'voices' necessarily being projected by a human. UVP is required to properly experience counterpoint in 2-3 (and, to a certain extent, 4) voices with either sperate melodies, or those melodies being played out of phase in dynamic ways.

Each of these aspects is necessarily required to percieve the other aspects mentioned. All of these musical experiences are completing lacking in non-UV perception, but arise together when UVP is activated.

When UVP arises, the mind interprets musical instruments as having vocal qualities (altering the perception of their timbre from what it previously was). In doing so their mind personifies the instruments and potentially projects empathetic qualities on them, desiring to follow instrumental melodies as if they were sung by people speaking a language and conversing to each other in tones. 


It is important to note what lacking UVP does not prevent. A person without UVP is fully capable of hearing pitch and pitch intervals and feeling direct emotional content in music, they are not necessarily tone deaf in any sense. However, the qualities of what muscians term 'tonal' music and the analysable structures that fall out of the desire of the listener to feel resolved tensions on particular beats along with completed musical themes are entirely dependent on UVP-like perception of music and will not be experienced by people lacking this quality.

I cannot rule out the possibility that certain people may have only developed Voice Perception relative to certain sounds, including particular families of musical instruments, but without developing full UVP. Since I have little understandning of why someone might selectively associate 'voiceness' and the empathetic qualities that follow that with the human voice, but only selectively, I don't udnerstand to what degree such an association is inate or dependent on learned experience.
