-1. Human reason is conditioned by its physical construction. Our brains developed according to physical processes, filtered by natural selection along with the specific mechanisms which allow aspects of individuals (as types of patterns) to be copied.
-2. Kant is fundamentally correct, according to this view, that in seeking to discover the nature of reality, we cannot escape the fact that our experience of reality is fundamentally conditioned by ourselves and how our own minds perceive the world.
-3. However, modern science has allowed a more significant glimpse into how it is that our minds may be structured so as to allow the processes of reason that do occur to arise as they do.
-4. This, however, says very little about the 'hard issue of consciousness' and how it is that specific phenomena arise from the apparently merely physical mind.
-5. The elements that are the subject of reason are generally, from the 'internal' perspectives of our own minds, grounded in subjective mental phenomena.
-Our knowledge of structure itself, including that of what we know of our physical brain structure, is built up out of such mental phenomena.
-6. These phenomena are, as far as we can tell, themselves grounded in physical structure.
-7. This may not strictly be the best way to describe the connection between consciousness and physical structure though, as it may not be meaningfully true to say that physical-structure-in-time is the cause of subjective mental phenomena, any more than the converse is true (that subjective phenomena are in some way the absolute cause of the physical structures that seemingly underlie them, which in a sense would imply 'willfulness' of matter, if not strictly free will). It is especially important to consider that the phenomena arise together, and with have no actual hard reason to hold that one necessarily follows on from the other in a direct cause and effect relation in time.
* The very nature of cause and effect relations are themselves nebulous too.

- Because of this, it is my best guess to say that both physical-structure-in-time and mental phenomena are two aspects of a single thing-in-itself that necessarily arise together. I posit that this necessity of arising together is a universal absolute, as for this to not be the case would admit the possibility (in the degenerate case) of P-zombies and more.

-8. The 'P-zombie movie' thought experiment shows that, if one accepts that possibility of P-zombies, that the results of this necessarily allows such absurdity and that needs to be acknowledged by anyone who holds such beliefs. I can't completely rule out that idea that even such events might be possible, but I will suppose that they are so bizarre and unreasonable that it greatly reduces the likely-hood of P-zombies being possible (from my perspective) in principal to the point where I will take it for granted that they are not.
-9. In saying that they are not (9), I am claiming that this is a universal absolute. That is, that not only is it not possible for P-zombies to exist in our reality, but that they cannot exist in principal in any reality, even if someone argues that they are somehow conceivable by their own mind (which I argue would simply be a mistaken conception in the same way that a child who might think that a million and a billion are basically the same - because they are both so large and beyond his imagination - would be mistaken if mathematical Platonism is taken to be true).

- There may be no way to distinguish between "physicality with mental phenomina as epiphenomena" and "willfulness".
- If they cannot actually be distinguished in any meaningful way, than any conceivable distinction between them is likely illusionary.
-"Willfulness" still would not imply freedom of the will from physical structure if we accept these universal absolutes.


- Anthropomorphism and bias.

-Sliced brain thought experiment (relies on affirmation of Chinese room and Chinese nation thought experiments).

-At a fundamental level, it may be said that the universe is discreet or continuous (or possibly a combination of both or something else entirely that we may not be able to understand).
-Regardless, it seems to be possible that continuous structures can approximate discreet ones to arbitrary degrees and, to the extent on the fineness of the granularity of the discreetness, the reverse is also possible.
-Because of this, the fundamental nature of the foundational structure of our universe may not be all that important with regard to how consciousness actually forms out of it.
-However, it may turn out to be the case that the very possibility of discreetness or continuity may itself be a universal absolute - i.e. that existing reality can only actually be comprised of actually discreet structures, or actually continuous structures, or even forms that cannot be said to be either - and that our perception that the other is possible arises out of our own subjective apprehension.
- However, assuming that is true that our own subjective apprehension is something that itself is necessarily intertwined with structure according to what I have previously stated, and as such apprehension and the structures it necessarily arises out of (or with) can be potentially based on either discreet or continuous structures, it seems to me that it is then a universal absolute that is it necessarily possible for thinking, reasoning beings* to be able to conceive of both discreet and continuous structures regardless of whether one or the other, or even both, may actually not be the actual basis of our reality, given that the possibility of either approximating the other is there and that we do seem to have the ability to conceive of such structures.
* By this I mean that it is possible for such beings to exist (as clearly we at least exist as examples), not that all possible beings that may be capable of doing something that is called thinking or reasoning will necessarily be able to conceive of such structures.
-I will assume that the structures that consciousness is based on are hence some generalization of discreetness and continuity regardless of the actual basis and that theories of consciousness that necessarily assume either must be in principal generalization to the other.


-To describe a passage of music as a theme, you are not strictly saying much about the structure of the music alone, but you are rather making a claim about how the passage is experienced as a a set of connected phenomena in the mind of a specific individual or number of individuals.
