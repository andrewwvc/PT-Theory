High schools students dread discussions of symbolism. This is perfectly natural of course, as they for the most part have every reason to consider the topic abhorrent. Why have things turned out like this? That's something I want to explore.

Now the typical 'literature class view' of symbolism tends to go like this: An author has written a novel. This novel, in particular ways, contains 'symbols', which are things or attributes of things within the context of the novel which potentially 'stand for' other things. The purpose of these symbols is to communicate something, some message of other that the reader is supposed to pick up, that they stand for. However, there's also a catch, this 'meaning', in most cases, is going to be unclear and possibly ambiguous, so its up to you, the reader, to do some legwork. The reader must puzzle out 'what the author really intended', in the hope of uncovering the messages, only that isn't quite true either, it may be possible to interpret many conflicting messages within the author's work, and maybe the original intention shouldn't matter, maybe the work itself should be scoured alone, and as long as you can support your interpretation, it can be considered a valid meaning. So we have something that apparently was written with the intent to communicate something, and which is valuable because of this. Yet the thing that it's supposedly communicating is ambiguous, possibly to the point of being so that the opposite of a given meaning could also be interpreted as being valid, as long as you can give your teacher a convincing argument for this. Yet this too is supposedly a virtue of the work, that it supports multiple such interpretations, and this is seemingly a signification of its richness. Of course it's also a bonus if these interpretations happen to coincide with the political views the teacher happens to hold.
