Tragedy is a word with unfortunate connotations in modern times. This is understandable, given the subject matter that it typically deals with. But as an artform, tragedy - when fully experienced - is vastly less bleak than it is popularly thought to be. I'm hardly the first person to make this point, and by now its been said in different ways by so many philosophers and critics throughout history that it may seem superfluous to try to add to all that has been said. [INSERT REFERENCES HERE]  However, I have my own perspective to offer, and I feel it is worthwhile to state it in order to shed light on on my own feelings and how they compare to those of various aestheticians of the past.





--Comment on how tragedy doesn't even necessitate unfortunate events, and can end happily, with the only way to judge to value of the plot, to the extent it serve the tragedy, being what it achieves aesthetically. As such, ostensibly happy endings can be tragic as long as they express the fundamental drama of tragedy and allows the free exercise of compassion through this, and essentially all tragedy is ultimately happy from the perspective of someone who fully perceives tragedy as an art.



Many aspects of tragedy as an artform stand out as notable qualities of it. The way that, despite often dealing with normally terrible subjects, it is experienced in a way that is exasperatingly pleasurable, at least in an observer who is receptive to experiencing tragedy as (arguably) intended by the writers of it. Many explanations of how this pleasure might be possible in spite of the horror have been proposed, and I believe that this can be accounted for through personal accounts of tragic experience. I will say that my perception of tragedy matches closely with that of Frederick Nietzsch, that of...



Normally, a given person will tend to perceive the world in a particular way, from a particular kind of moral standpoint. In this mode of ethical perception, the subject will empathize heavily with people similar to themselves, and who they perceive as being 'good' people, or at least those who share a similar worldview to their own. If someone perceives someone else as having a good nature, then they will want that person to have good fortune and, especially if they know that person well, will hate the idea of any harm coming to them, which they will resent if they actively see anything befall them. This will trigger strong feelings of empathy towards the pain felt by another. Conversely, seeing someone who is radically different from yourself, who is possibly perceived as being unvirtuous, and further more who has committed some crime or transgressed some moral boundary (or is even in the very act of doing so), will not prompt this empathetic response. Instead, we do not care what befalls this person, and will actively desire harm to come to someone we have marked as guilty and deserving of punishment. We will not feel his suffering matters, and our empathy is naturally contingent on how we have marked this person, as a sinner or as someone relatively innocent. And this is naturally subject to all kinds of human complexity. Someone who kills someone we have marked as an enemy, even if they are no worse or less virtuous then that person and would have been right to do the same themselves, will still be empathized in the same way as an innocent as long as we are acquainted with them and they are on our side.



The tragic mode of ethical perception is different. What it does is fascinating. There is something strangely delightful about it, as it allows us to be simultaneously compassionate and sadistic towards a single agent. Essentially, instead of having the normal empathetic response which depends on your regard towards a person, resulting in you caring about their welfare in a given way, tragedy essentially short circuits and subverts this response by constructing a scenario where slotting a person into being worthy of a given kind of regard - being virtuous or innocent or guilty in a given respect - no longer makes sense. Basically the background mentality that results in your compassion being dished out differently to different people gets a fork thrown in it, letting you partially step out outside of it and perceive its contingent nature, like surveying a frozen machine - instead of operating it - and seeing how each of its mechanisms fit together and lead to various outcomes. From the perspective you gain from tragic experience, you can survey part of the landscape of your own moral impulses. You can't 'see' them directly, but you do gain perspective of them, where you can feel how they interrelate and where the moral substance they rely on breaks down. It is in realizing this break down of conventional moral and causal impulses, and feeling it as something perceived intuitively, that tragedy works its magic. A tragedy, well constructed, is like a elaborate machine who's real purpose is to rip itself apart and show its innards. When you, the spectator, gain an understanding of the totality of dramatic actions and what they seem to imply about moral feeling, how we perceive intent and causality, etc. through the experience of the tragic drama, you naturally come to feel the naivety of limited, one sided views of these things. This doesn't mean that you can't say, fully agree with the actions of one character or agent and side with them over another character who opposes them - this is a freedom the tragic experience completely allows - but in doing so you, as a sensitive viewer desiring the full richness and honesty of tragedy, will acknowledge the opposing moral boundary this invariably transgresses, however you may regard it; because you wouldn't want to be ignorant of this, because as such you would rob yourself of the pleasure of this dynamic understanding. Because it is the pleasure of seeing through naivety, of being compassionate beyond the normal limits of our moral impulses, and being about to feel delight and satisfaction in seeing actions that cause suffering to characters we admire instead of sorrow and frustration, the fuels the drive of tragedy.

--NOTE: Comment on fear of tragedy - about how someone may worry about their own lack of ability to understand and feel tragedy as above, seemingly only experiencing sadness at the prospect of characters being killed off. Comment on how I also did not understand initially, until I experienced tragedy in terms of a kind of moral counterpoint, and hence experienced its 'truth' and beauty purely, without bitterness (since acknowledging their guilt instinctively puts them outside the sphere of ordinary moral affection).

--Comment on the tragic, objective, compassionate nature of counterpoint and its similarity to tragic dialog.



I believe that tragedy has much in common with the art of counterpoint. In each case, expressions of Awareness play off each other. This similarity will be seen most aptly when the very dialog of the tragedy takes upon certain musical aspects of form. Sometimes, the dialog will be in verse, and so the dialog of multiple speakers will continue their patterns of syllabic beats irregardless of the particular speaker, hence the contrasting dialogues will feel to fold into each other. Sometimes, speakers may speaker over each other, letting speech overlap directly in time so that each character airs their viewpoints to the other and simultaneously listens to the others, while the audience receives both. Other times, neither such poetic display occurs, the drama instead occurs in plain speech - and yet it may still contain a certain amount of this naturally musical quality to it, not directly though actual rhythm or counterpoint, but through the feeling of the drama itself.



In much the same way I have generalized the sentence and the musical theme into the canonical sequence, I will generalize the individual vocal line in counterpoint from music and the individual speaking character's lines in a drama into a common abstraction called an (aspect of) Awareness. Each aspect of Awareness is both an object of compassion in itself, and at the same time perceived as being capable of feeling sympathy for the other aspects of awareness it may be put into (generalized) counterpoint with. People naturally feel for characters. And in music, vocal lines in counterpoint seem to serve a similar role, they will appear -to someone with EVP - as emotional objects, deserving of sympathy, interacting, responding to each other as the music plays out. They are not necessarily experienced as coherent individuals (though lacking SGP will force the listener to feel them with a certain degree of individualization), but there is still a sense of expressive character to them, an aliveness that I express here through the term Awareness.



The awareness creates a dialectic in unison. Each part of the drama, the actor rhapsodizing, the instrument phrasing itself, seems to be to some arbitrary degree aware of the nature of what it is counterpoised against, being intimately connected with and wanting to understand it to some arbitrary degree. Yet at the same time it is still opposed to the counterpart awareness, each mutually reflecting on each other in their opposition. ...



--NOTE: Comment on emotional objectification in comparison to direct emotion.



Similar to how I say there is an 'ordinary' mode of empathy in contrast to tragic compassion, likewise with music there is the 'ordinary' experience of direct emotional engagement, which contrasts with that of empathetic objectification of musical Awarenesses. An important distinction between the tragic mode and that of musical objectification that I must continue to stress is that, while musical objectification requires EVP, tragedy in general doesn't demand any particular modal faculty that I am aware of. A given tragedy, like a Shakespeare play, may specifically demand one (SGP in this case), but other tragedies may not, and yet still be experienced as tragedy, unlike the experience of musical themes in counterpoint as Awarenesses via EVP.



In ordinary engagement with music, the experience is of direct affection, whatever is happening right now in the music will directly affect your mood and feelings. This effect will not always be instant, as previously experienced sound will affect how you are affected by sound shortly after, in this way beats and melodies are meaningful, the the general mood the music establishes can set a base of feeling that can be felt in contrast with other moods if the music progresses though things like changes in tempo or mode. Patterns of verse can set up expectations of leading to a chorus or bridge, and yet various musical events can happen basically arbitrarily without necessarily grossly violating any feelings of natural inevitability. The music can come to a halt or it may fade out into the background.



-Even in the ancient world, tragedies with more heavily didactic moral viewpoints, such as many of Euripides, were considered inferior to those which might have what might be said to have freer approaches to morality.



While I have stressed the importance of specific modal faculties, like EVP and SGP, with respect to the ability to perceiving the value in specific forms of art, tragedy is not in general dependent on any I have identified. That is to say, while certain specific tragic works may rely on highly poetic language or music that may require one modal faculty or another, it is still possible to create tragedy that is not dependent on either, as I was able to understand and experience the nature of tragic art prior to gaining either faculty. The plays of Henrik Ibsen are examples of such works that seemingly do not demand these faculties of perception. However, it may be said that the perception of tragedy depends on the ability to view morality and moral dilemmas in a specific way, so it may well be the case that certain people, such as psychopaths, may not be capable of this (though I will distinctly not rule out this possibility, it may be the case that the moral perspective that tragedy offers is very much accessible to the psychopath, as it is a perspective that allows one to abstract from direct concern towards an individual).
