Stage 1: 'Naive' (N)

Musical experience -

- The defult, 'direct' perception of sound that, I suspect, most children likely have.
- Music appealing to people with on this level involves immediate perception of sounds along with emotions felt as a consequence of this perception, and works through the contrast of these feelings and impulses together in time.
- You just like, feel the music, man. Music seems to have no higher level organisation what affects your perception of it other than your immediate emotional state. 
- Within this stage, it is possible to learn how to more accurately percieve the pich of individual notes in a piece of music without advancing to another stage.
- Any and all melodies must share the same musical phrase structure in order to be percieved at the same time. Nothing can be "out of phase" or in a diffrent key.
- Nothing can be said to be "in a key" in the first place at this stage, as the naive listener will not percieve any need for the music to resolve into a particular note, sequence or chord.
- Time signature changes are quite unplesent and throw off whatever feeling and sense of flow the music had before.
- Anything that a higher stage listener would perceive as musical tension or release is impossible at this level. Such elements are percieved as sheer dissonassonse and are simply unconfortable to listen to.
- Symphonies, and the violin parts in particular, have sonic qualities can be described as harsh, piercing and wet/watery/damp at the same time.
- Likely the least mentally filtered and most raw perception of sound texture.

Poetic expereience -

- Poems are only percieved as such if they rhyme.
- In addition, as far as I can tell, the rhymes and line breaks will only be felt to make real sense then they fall apon nouns, or verbs used as nouns at the end of a sentence. This at least applies to English.
- All other poetic effects are basically meaningless and and imperceptible.

Theory -

In this state, voice perception is selective. By this, I mean that when hearing sounds, some of them will be percieved as 'voice like', and processesd using the language processing powers of the brain, whle other sounds are not. What actually is the initial cause of this I can not say specifically, but acessing subsequent perception throsholds changes this.


Stage 2: 'Thematic/Phrase Vocal' (PV)

Transition to this stage occured in myself in 2011, while listening to Gustav Leonhardt's performance of the harsichord solo of J.S. Bach's 5th Brandenburg concerto

- Musical instruments gain voice like sound qualities in this stage of perception. One may feel like they can empathise with them as if they are characters acting out a script and responding to one another.
- Voices percieved as communicating, personified entities.
-Individual musical phreases may feel like 'emotional subjects', not felt directly by the listener, but offering intelectual perceptiosn of feeling to be contrasted with others.
- Theme focused
- Clear distinction between multiple musical lines in concertios and (to a certain, but lesser extent) symphonic music becomes perceptable. Previously, in N, only one melody at a time would be followable, even if the listener is aware of more.
- Two musicals lines can effortlessly be percieved in counterpoint, three with some concentration, and four with much cognitive burdon.
- Melodies can be interpreted as themes that repeat themselves in varied transformations. These transformations are not necessarily accessible or interprited by the brain as actual variations of a single 'thing' in N. Instead, they will be perceived as arbitrary patterns of notes with no specific connection to each other until PV is attained.
- Self similar melodies can be embeded inside a musical theme.
- There is a strong desire and expectation that all musical phrase structures that 'should' end with a resolution to a tonic (in that they are indroduced as doing as and may eventually resolve in a cadence later on when repeated), actually do so. If this doesn't happen in a given instance, it will likely frustrate the listener. As such, hierarchical structure in a piece, or a perceptual shadow of it, may be perceived but not actually understood or appreciated at this level.
- Clarinets take on an 'electric', etherial sounding timbre.
- The previously less than plesant qualities of the violin timbre are revealed to be what enables them to be percieved as voice like in this stage, so their grating qualities resolve.
- The feel of becomming familiar with 

Poetic expereience -

- Poems with rhyming structure can now be broken up on non-nouns. This allows for larger scale structure based aroud breaking lines, as to fold parts of sentences and actions around themselves. This still takes significant cognitive effort.

Theory -

As far as I can tell, PV is related to the potential for interpritation of structures related to regular grammer in the Chomsky hierarchy and are subject to the limitations of these structures. I initally thought they related to context free structure, as hierarchical structures exist and are intelligable intelectually, but the depth of a structure within a given piece of music will not feel meaningful. Hence there is no intuitive sense of why the cadence would need to be the length it is to 'unwind' the structure of the musical piece and complete it, though the sequence of notes that feels like it should potentially lead to final chord will be anticipated and felt, lending the sense that the music is "IN a key", e.g. the whole struture of he piece is contained within tension(s) that feel the need to be resolved into specific classes of chord sequences.

*NOTE: May contain additional substages, which I'll label A and B for now. The only distinction is that at one point I went from finding it impossible to make sense of the solos in Beethoven's piano sonatas to being able to in general, independent of my familiarity of the structure of any piece in question. Though this may be down to my familiarty with the sonic qualities of the piano and/or listening through different headphones (Grados) before going back to the original pair.


Stage 3: 'Super Gramatical' (SG)

Transition to this stage occured in myself, date: 18/02/2016

- Perception of multi-layered hierarchical structures with architectural qualities.
- Comprehension of music at this level, as I understand it, enables what has been refered to as "listening on the pure musical level".
- Self similar melodies can be interprited as meaningful on several simultanious levels in SG, and with little concious effort, in contrast to the directed focus that's required in PV perception.
- Voice 'identity' breaks down and becomes unnecessary. No longer does any perceptual need to categorise vocal lines into distinct entities arise. Any part of any melodic line can be felt to be a response to any other part. No need to personify instruments or melodic lines any more.
- Appreciation of trills and rapid, ambiguous variations of pitch can arise. This otherwise still sounds distateful in the absense of SG.
- Experience of full polyphony as harmony. As such harmony takes on perceptual qualities in SG that are closer to how 'naive' harmonies were felt. PV perception is distinctly less harmonious and involves experiencing musical lines in counterpoint as seperate parts.
- 3 to 4 voices and the way they fit into each other and harmonise are perceptible without undue effort. Can be aware of 5-6 vocal lines, possibly more especially if some feel subordonate to others, along with more ambiguous symphonic harmonisation.
- Multi-instumental concertos where multiple themes pass through variations in instrumentation make far more sense.
- Bass notes are more noticable and feel more impactful. On the whole, orchestral compositions feel more balanced.
- No longer a constant need to return to a single tonic note through a direct path, instead a phrase boundery can end early and be responded to with another instance of a similar, embeded phrase structure at the same hierarchical level in the piece.

Poetic expereience -

- Enables the perception of the structure of blank and free verse.
- Can read poems as if they were plain speach and the subconsious will scan the meter without consious mental effort.
- Otherwise 'free' metrical structures are basically imperceptible
- Alliteration and repetition of phonic and/or grammatic structures becomes noticably meaningful and invites comparison and/or mental extention of gramatical structure.
- Metaphor is experienced in a direct and intutive manner. Imagery naturally combines to form higher, and potentially more abstract, ideas and even metaphorical imagery in unmetered prose is intuitively, vividly and directly experienced. Prior to this level, metaphor can only be understood in a relatively analytical fashion and does not invite the same higher, abstract powers of imagination nor is it as immediately striking to the reader to the same extent. As such, it needs to be understood that "high poetic metaphor" is distinct from other kinds of metaphor, and only acessible to people with Stage 3 perception.


    * I wish to also investigate Japanese poetic forms in the original language, despite only limited prior experience.
    
Perosnal Experience -

- On reaching this stage I found that I percieved intervals of time (reletively large scale, generally over half an hour) to be much shorter and found myself feeling less need for sleep. I discovered I felt bored due to lack of activity must less often in a profound way.
- I gained the ability to context switch between visual and audio awareness far more freely, rapidly and easily, in an instant to a few seconds, depending on level of immersion. No longer did it take minutes of concentration to switch my perceptive focus, as it did when I only possessed PV experience.
- I found, that when I tried to practice speed reading after reaching this stage, I could read much faster with much less cognitive burden than ever before. 600 WPM is a comfortable speed for me at this point, whe nprio, it was the limit of my cognitive capacity and incredibly fatiguing. I found I could reach 900WPM, even on highly dense and difficult to read texts, and still understand them.

    
    
Stage 3x 'Self Referential' (SR):

This is a hypothetical stage that I'm not sure exists. It involves the development of SG perception prior to PV perception. It could be non-existant, but may actually be common and could explain why few people consiously experience PV development along with the sudden, striking perception of universal voice (at least those who have not taken hallucinogenics, which I believe may allow these perception thresholds to be reached far more easily).

It could also be possible, but otherwise quite rare, and may explain the quirks of musicians like Glenn Gould (who felt the need to vocalise his keyboard performances, loved J.S. Bach's highly architectural music while hating Mozart's more heavily lyrical music). If it does exist, I cannot say myself exactly what the experience of it would be like, but I suspect it would enable perception of SG style self simalarity, but in an isolated fashion and without the sense of grammatical 'evaluation' involved in SG. It may allow, for instance, the intitive perception of meter in blank verse, but without necessarily allowing this to result in mentally meaningful evaluation of a poem's unity or composition.

Ravel's late work could likely be explained through the opposite situation, he once had, but then lost SG perception, hence the personally regretful constructon of his Bolero.

Debussy likely spend signifiantly longer in his youth without the higher perception layers, hence his love direct feeling connected with implied imagery, later integrating this influence into higher level structures and still deliberately choosing to compose some 'naive' music.


Additional Notes of Potential Theoretical Importance

Hypothatically, other stages, either higher (such as to enable greater super rational artistic expression) or lower (the inability to percieve beat patterns or pitch) may be said to exist. But this covers the perception thresholds that I have personally experienced and that I know to be activatable, even if they are currently dormant in a given person.

I have myself spoken to and heard of a number of other people who have made leaps in musical perception that changed their taste. I beleive that I have an understanding which should specifically allow development of actual theory relating to this.

It must me noted that the perception layers affect current experience, but not the memory of past experiences.

This theory may explain why, when significant numbers of people in a given population may not have significant musical education, a taste for Western Art Music is rare in younger demographics while more commogn in older people. Specifcally, it is not that older people are more emotionally equipped to deal with the music, as certain people might otherwise believe, it's probable that their perception is more likely to have advanced at some point the longer they've been alive.

I need to say that, while I believe this theory may have significant applications beyond the specifics discussed here, I am adamant that I do not intend it to become some catch all, pop science explanation for progression of an individual's psychological development or differences in perception or taste in general, which doubless have many other factors involved. I do believe that there is much psychological and philosophical value to be gained purely through understanding introspective expereince and directly discussing and comparing it with that of others, independant of "as objective as feasible" scientific studies and statistics based research. Having said that, being aware of the issues with potentially unfalsifiable (as per Karl Popper) ideas due to dependence of my theory of personal experience that is imperceptible to others, I also propose that while surveying personal experience is of great value, it should be possible to devise tests that attempts evaluate the perception thresholds a given individual likely has which produce results that meaningfully corelate. For instance, a native English speaker who can meaningfully appreciate musical structre on a 'pure musical' level should be far more likely to intuitively understand the poetic meter, form and imagery of blank verse poetry than someone who doens't. As such, people who wish to study this theory scientifically should be able to conduct studies that show such correlations if this theory is true.

However, I cannot completely agree with K. Popper on the validity of ad hoc changes to a given scientific theory if counter evidence arises against it. If a theory models something with sufficiently good predictive powers, then it makes sense to at least try to salvage it when no other theory yet exists to succed it. This doesn't justify constant revisions, which may indicate there is something wrong with the theory and will lend evidence to the idea that there may be a fundumentally diffrent explanation. Tastes will be clouded by cultural experience and there are no doubt many other factors which are outside the scope of this specific framework that will affect specific results. This is not a nerological based prediction, as it is based on my own personal experience and my conjecture that a large number of experiences humans have have with beat structure based artforms and voice/language perception will match up with these specific, theoretically discret stages. While my theoretical framework could be said to be unfalsifiable in some sense, as it deals with psychic phenomina of the mind as its primary subject adn cannot make predictions in terms of absolute numbers, it would be perfectly resonable for a given individual to judge it to be unlikely to be a true account of general human psycholgy if it turns out to not apply to many people of the correlations conjectured are statistically weak. 

Theory should explain significant aspects of the OPERA hypothesis.
